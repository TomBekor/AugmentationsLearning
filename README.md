# Augmentations Learning
### Experiment:
Trying to learn the parameters of applied augmentations on the Tiny ImageNet. <br>
Its all about the learning rate and scheduler!<br>
1 layer augmentation working perferct for: brightness, contrast, rotation, shearX, translateX.
Added: Multi-layered augmentations - currently working with translateX + contrast.
